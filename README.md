# Seismic-Event-Forecasting-Model
## Earthquake Magnitude Prediction

## Overview

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict earthquake magnitudes based on a dataset of global seismic events. The dataset, `Global_Earthquake_Data.csv`, contains various features related to earthquakes, including magnitude, depth, and location.

## Dataset

The dataset `Global_Earthquake_Data.csv` includes the following features:
- `title`: Title of the earthquake event
- `magnitude`: Magnitude of the earthquake
- `date_time`: Date and time of the event
- `cdi`: Community Internet Intensity Map
- `mmi`: Modified Mercalli Intensity
- `alert`: Alert level issued
- `tsunami`: Whether a tsunami was generated
- `sig`: Significance of the event
- `net`: Network that reported the event
- `nst`: Number of stations reporting
- `dmin`: Minimum distance to the event
- `gap`: Gap between stations
- `magType`: Type of magnitude measurement
- `depth`: Depth of the earthquake
- `latitude`: Latitude of the event
- `longitude`: Longitude of the event
- `location`: Location description
- `continent`: Continent where the event occurred
- `country`: Country where the event occurred
